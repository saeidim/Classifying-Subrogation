# Classifying-Subrogation

Model created by Saeid Iranmanesh
I use a data set (worker compensation) from an insurance company to classify subrogation (1=Yes 0=No) using NN based on adjustor notes (text data).
“Subrogation is a legal right afforded to insurance companies. It allows an insurer to recover the amount paid for a loss by suing the party that caused the loss”.
See the process along with the data set in the attachment.”
